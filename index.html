      <p>Where indeed?</p>
      <p>
        Lost, found, somewhere in between. Humanity is at a turning point, where entities 
        of influence and power war against one another in an effort to impose their will. 
        Whether you be a pawn, a knight, or a king, you are still just a part of the game.
        The rules are nonexistant, the goal isto find the answer to a question. One question 
        to last until the end of time, when the stars fade to black and the univers is still. 
        Who, what, where are you?

      <p>In the beginning there were fleeting particles of light and matter, pinwheeling through an endless void. These particles gave way to atoms, atoms to molecules, molecules to tissues, tissues to organs, organs to animalsâ€“ yet all are just as insignificant as the last in an infinite universe. For all our power, our ingenuity, our strength, and our wickedness, we are less than pawns in the vast machine of existence. We live and we die, we rise and we fall, and we will soon fade out of this continuum, nothing more than a brief disturbance in the rippling fabric of reality. To dissuade this notion we fancy ourselves immortal conquerors, fighting and killing over insignificant trivialities until our inevitable demise. We are truly a tragic race.</p>
      <p>But through all of our hubris and spite, we cling together. Desperately, unable and unwilling to let go, we hold each other tightly as we spin through this empty nothingness. Not one of us wishes to face this burden alone. Now more than ever we are lost, falling, fading. Yet now, more than ever, we must hold on. Find someone, another soul who understands your plight. Run to them, and open your arms as they run to you. Hold them, do not let them go, as we plummet into an endless sea of dying stars. And stay with them, as we walk where giants fly.</p>
