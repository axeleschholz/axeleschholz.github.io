### Which key concept or theory from this course resonated with you the most, and how has it influenced your understanding of technology's impact on society?

The concept that resonated with me the most throughout this class was that of convergence. Every topic covered in the lectures related in some way to this idea of a converging technological society, where each development contributes to a greater level of reach and flexibility to the online world. Furthermore, as the internet becomes more amorphous, centralized, and accessible, it raises questions about how society is impacted by this new level of connectivity.

As technology converges, its progress accelerates exponentially. In fact, it has already reached a pace at which humans are struggling to keep up, not only with technological understanding, but also with the resulting rapid societal shifts. Being privileged, or perhaps cursed, to live in an era that promises drastic reckoning with the challenges presented by the convergence, I hope to work in the forefront of this socio-technological wave.
