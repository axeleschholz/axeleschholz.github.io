### How do you think the advent of digital payment gateways, such as PayPal or Apple Pay, has influenced trust in online shopping?

I remember very well in the early days of ecommerce the hesitance that surrounded putting payment information online. But in these early days, this hesitance was warranted, especially for small online retailers, as it was very difficult to police how individual websites processed and stored this information. For a small corporation, earning sufficient consumer trust and brand recognition to overcome this hurdle was very difficult.

However, the emergence of centralized payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe has neatly solved this issue by allowing large corporations with consumer trust derived from relative transparency, accountability, and size to extend this trust to smaller entities. Not only did this go a long way to allay fears about stolen payment information, but it also served to provide an intermediary that could insure against fraud.

There is a certain irony to this paradigm, as its emergence and maturation have happened in conjunction with a larger trend towards convergence on the internet. Ecommerce became centralized into sites like ebay, amazon, and shopify, thus eliminating much of the initial need for payment portals.
