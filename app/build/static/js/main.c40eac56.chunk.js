I often try to justify it to myself by saying that it is for the right reasons. But, until I\'ve delivered on that promise, those words ring hollow. As such, I find myself grappling with the vast ethical considerations of developing technology in the modern world. My current endeavor focuses around identity, and is theoretically the antithesis to the anonymity of the early internet age. While this could have potentially incredible benefits to trust accountability in an online world, there is no doubt that it flirts dangerously with currently held notions of privacy ethics. As such, it is imperative that we take this into consideration as we move forward with this project.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think the more terrifying aspect of this whole discussion is not the monumental challenge of how I plan to consider these factors when building in the next era of the internet, but rather why I have this responsibility in the first place. If the onus to develop ethical technologies is solely on the tech companies themselves, then executives will no doubt cut corners for the sake of the bottom line. Until effective regulation is implemented at a high enough level, no meaningful change can be effected.\\r\\n"},{"slug":"post2","title":"Journal 2","author":"Axel Eschholz","content":"\\r\\n### Real-world Implications: What lessons can startups and new companies take from today\'s LLL activity?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis activity, even in its most basic form, would be a suitable practice for every startup to adopt. Startup culture lends itself to haphazard, fast solutions, which are the antithesis of effective security. Furthermore, when one is inside a system it is often hard to see potential vulnerabilities. Reviewing a security policy from the lens of an objective observer trying to exploit it forces a reckoning with potential security flaws.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother lesson that startups can take from this activity is the sheer complexity and multifaceted nature of effective security on the modern web. Another product of startup culture can sometimes be the oversimplification of critical processes, and security is a common victim of this mentality. This activity can help to convey how much thought and effort needs to be put into this aspect of a business, and therefore encourage the dedication of sufficient resources.\\r\\n"},{"slug":"post3","title":"Journal 4","author":"Axel Eschholz","content":"\\r\\n### Technological and Ethical Impacts: Dive deep into the ethical challenges of the AI age, especially in terms of biased algorithms. How can developers ensure fairness and transparency in machine learning models?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the million dollar question. As we discussed in class, an AI\u2019s perspective on the world is entirely determined by its training data, much like a human\u2019s perspective is determined by their life experience. However, presenting an AI with truly \u201cunbiased\u201d data, if that is even possible, is exceedingly difficult. This is because the entirety of human history and texts are biased in some way. For example, if you feed an AI western historical texts written over the last 100 years, it will undeniably develop the white colonial bias inherent in the overwhelming majority of the works. Similarly, if you train the AI on the last 5 years of Reddit and Twitter posts, it would become an unhinged reflection of the worst instincts of humanity. Thus the problem of eliminating bias in AI becomes the problem of curating an unbiased reflection of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo go a bit beyond the point at hand, this conundrum is indicative of a fascinating shift in the field of AI research. As models become sufficiently complex, dense, and obscure, the practice of AI development becomes much less hard science and more akin to philosophy. As the technical aspects continue to be abstracted away, effective AI development may prioritize comprehensive knowledge of sociology and philosophy over technical skill. In an extreme example it\u2019s amusing to consider that we might come full circle, where a Bachelor of Psychology graduate is making three times the starting salary of a computer scientist right out of school.\\r\\n"},{"slug":"post4","title":"Journal 5","author":"Axel Eschholz","content":"\\r\\n### How do you think the advent of digital payment gateways, such as PayPal or Apple Pay, has influenced trust in online shopping?\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember very well in the early days of ecommerce the hesitance that surrounded putting payment information online. But in these early days, this hesitance was warranted, especially for small online retailers, as it was very difficult to police how individual websites processed and stored this information. For a small corporation, earning sufficient consumer trust and brand recognition to overcome this hurdle was very difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the emergence of centralized payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe has neatly solved this issue by allowing large corporations with consumer trust derived from relative transparency, accountability, and size to extend this trust to smaller entities. Not only did this go a long way to allay fears about stolen payment information, but it also served to provide an intermediary that could insure against fraud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain irony to this paradigm, as its emergence and maturation have happened in conjunction with a larger trend towards convergence on the internet. Ecommerce became centralized into sites like ebay, amazon, and shopify, thus eliminating much of the initial need for payment portals.\\r\\n"},{"slug":"post5","title":"Journal 6","author":"Axel Eschholz","content":"\\r\\n### Which key concept or theory from this course resonated with you the most, and how has it influenced your understanding of technology\'s impact on society?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept that resonated with me the most throughout this class was that of convergence. Every topic covered in the lectures related in some way to this idea of a converging technological society, where each development contributes to a greater level of reach and flexibility to the online world. Furthermore, as the internet becomes more amorphous, centralized, and accessible, it raises questions about how society is impacted by this new level of connectivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs technology converges, its progress accelerates exponentially. In fact, it has already reached a pace at which humans are struggling to keep up, not only with technological understanding, but also with the resulting rapid societal shifts. Being privileged, or perhaps cursed, to live in an era that promises drastic reckoning with the challenges presented by the convergence, I hope to work in the forefront of this socio-technological wave.\\r\\n"}]')}},[[190,1,2]]]);
